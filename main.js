More than anything I enjoyed diving into the code to search for answers any time I was asked the classic question-- is this issue a bug, user error, or intentional design upon which we can improve?", "My interest in the world of Devs grew exponentially in my time with CHS, and it soon became clear that Software Development was the rigorous, creative and exciting career for which I'd been searching. I knew I had to go all in, and enrolled in Nashville Software School's Full-Time Web Developer Bootcamp.", "I couldn't be more thrilled to be learning Full-Stack Development (Python/Django backend) with my bright and supportive classmates of NSS' Cohort 28, and can't wait to see what comes next."]
